            <h1>Change Stevens's Fate!</h1>
            <p>With your help, we can finally bury Gradarius once and for all,
                under the tears of students and the ashes of its software.
                Reach out to students at <a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank">Penn State University</a>,
                for they also struggle in the unfortunate circumstances
                Gradarius brings.

            <h1>Change Your Fate!</h1>
            <p>Before you lose hope on all of humanity because of
                Gradarius's disgrace, don't forget that you can always
                <a href="https://bit.ly/2DwO2dh" target="_blank">get some help from
                professionals.</a>
                There is always someone willing to help in CAPS (Counseling &
                Psychological Services) in the 7th Floor of Howe. The hours are
                as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Monday-Friday: 9AM-5PM
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Appointments are made in person from 9AM-5PM on weekdays,

                Be wary that they cannot be made over the <a href=
                "mailto:stevenscounseling@stevens.edu">CAPS email</a>,
                but you can still contact that email if you need assistance
                psychologically recovering from the tortures of Gradarius.
