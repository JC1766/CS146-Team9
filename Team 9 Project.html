                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In the era of modern technology, Stevens Institute
                        of Technology has risen up to take pride in its
                        title of <span>the Innovation University</span>.
                        However, a system called Gradarius has begun to
                        destroy this Innovation from the inside out.
                        Gradarius is an online Calculus assister developed
                        by one of Stevens own alumni.
                        We want to show you how there are better ways to do
                        math online other than the cancer that Stevens
                        students have to endure.
